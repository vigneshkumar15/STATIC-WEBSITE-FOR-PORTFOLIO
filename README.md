A static website for a portfolio is a simple website that showcases your work, skills, and projects using basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike dynamic websites, a static website doesn’t rely on databases or complex back-end systems. Instead, it displays fixed content that doesn’t change unless manually updated. This type of website is fast, easy to create, and cost-effective, making it a great choice for developers, designers, or creatives who want to present their work in a straightforward and professional way.
